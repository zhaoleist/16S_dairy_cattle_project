Background:\
Microbiota play important roles in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of dairy cattle as the communities are responsible for host health, growth, and production performance. However, a systematic characterization and comparison of microbial communities in the GIT of cattle housed in different management units on a modern dairy farm are still lacking. We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to evaluate the fecal bacterial communities of 90 dairy cattle housed in 12 distinctly defined management units on a modern dairy farm.

Interchangeble variables in the scripts:
1) OTU == ASV (though they came from different methods, consider them the same thing in the scripts)
2) stage == management unit (refer to the 12 units where the cattle live)
